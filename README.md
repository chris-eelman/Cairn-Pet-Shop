# Business idea

The name of our business is Blue Collar Pets. Blue Collar Pets is a pet store that specializes in presenting you with the cutest, hardworking, and loyal companions. Our signature blue collar represents the loyalty and dedication of each animal, as is our commitment to ensuring they find the perfect, loving home. In our website (bluecollarpets.com), we will display an introduction to our business and have a place for customers to view our selction of animals at Blue Collar Pets, and a way to initially conduct the adoption process. The data that needs to be stored for this project to function include: The business name and description, legal documents like adoption agreement and privacy policy documents; the DATA object would be the animals, this would look like having data that identifies each animal including their ID, type of animal, breed, age, gender, etc,..; other datas needed include a way to store the user input for the initial adoption process form which would include information like their name, contact, which animal they want to adopt, etc,.
